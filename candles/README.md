## Candles Problem

There is a candle sequence, and the length of each candle is random. Two people take turns taking candles. The rules are as follows:
1. Each person can only take one candle at a time;
2. It can only be taken from both ends of the candle sequence at a time;
3. Everyone hopes to get the longest total candle length;

Question: If you are the first player, how can you get the longest total length
